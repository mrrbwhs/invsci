        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5.2.2 – evaluate the methodology of the scientific investigations above by:
        <ul>
          <li>5.2.2.1 – justifying the method chosen based on the subject of the investigation and the context, for example: experimental testing, fieldwork, locating and using information sources, conducting surveys and using modelling and simulations</li>
          <li>5.2.2.2 – evaluating the relevance of the investigation by considering the peer-reviewed literature in the area of study</li>
          <li>5.2.2.3 – justifying the suitability of the type of data that is to be collected</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>5.2.3 – develop a method most appropriate to test a hypothesis following observation</li>
      <li>5.2.4 – justify the type of methodology used to test the hypothesis</li>
